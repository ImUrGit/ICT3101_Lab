Epic: 
As a group of system quality engineers, we want to enhance our command-line calculator to calculate quality metrics 
such as defect density, total number of Shipped Source Instructions (SSI), and metrics using the Musa Logarithmic model. 
This will allow us to evaluate system performance across successive releases and predict failures more accurately, 
using a single calculator command.

User Story Examples:
User Story 1: 
As a system administrator, I want to calculate the Defect density using a calculator by inputting 
total number of defects over the size so that I can understand the defect density of my system.

User Story 2: 
As a system administrator, I want to calculate the system's availability by inputting MTBF and Mean Time to 
Repair (MTTR) into a calculator so that I can assess how much time the system is expected to be available.
